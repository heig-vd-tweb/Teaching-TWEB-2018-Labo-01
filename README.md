### Tasks

The mockup is divided into parts - the *profile widget*  at the top the *post widget*. 

1. Implement the *profile widget* **or** the *post widget* in a static web page. **It's not mandatory to implement both**.
2. Imagine a simple interaction and implement it with Javascript. For example users could...
   - toggle the follow button in the profile widget
   - or expand / collapse the post widget as shown in the picture.
3. When the implementation is finished, publish your prototype to a website and include the link to the website in your github repository.

### Technologies

**Development**

Keep in mind that the goal for this lab is to get comfortable with HTML, CSS and Javascript. You don't need any library or framework for this project. But if you are already familliar with web development and you want to try something new ( let say [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) or [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) ) feel free to use whatever you'd like.
